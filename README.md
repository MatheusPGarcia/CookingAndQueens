## **Chef Yourself**

**Descrição do projeto:**
Chef Yourself is an innovative recipe app made for every cook, no matter how experienced! Its main goal is to simplify your work on the kitchen by providing the following tools:

* Timer: Never let anything burn again! Easily set a timer that will remind you of anything you have left to cook!
* Ingredient List: Check every item you already have and shop only those you are sure you’ll need for the recipe!
* AppleWatch compatibility: We know it is pretty hard to keep checking you phone while cooking. Thus, we brought the step-by-step closer to you by showing it on the appleWatch companion app!

Bring your cooking skills to a whole new level with Chef Yourself!
